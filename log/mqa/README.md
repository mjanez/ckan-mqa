# Log folder
This folder is used to store logs generated by `ckan2pycsw` script and `catalog.rdf` file downloaded from `CKAN_CATALOG_URL`. Logs are essential for debugging and tracing the execution of the code. By keeping logs, you can track the behavior of your code over time, identify errors and performance issues, and improve the overall quality of your code.
